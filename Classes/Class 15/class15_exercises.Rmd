##Task Set 1: Non vectorised conditional
1. Correct the code below so that it runs.
The error is because I am missing an =
```{r}
animal <- sample(c("Birds", "Fish"), size = 1)

if(animal == "Fish"){
    print("I can swim")
} else {
    print("I can't swim")
}
```
2. Modify the code above to check if an animal is a "Bird" and print whether it can fly or not.

```{r}
animal <- sample(c("Birds", "Fish"), size = 1)

if(animal == "Birds"){
    print("I can fly")
} else {
    print("I can't fly")
}
```

3. Use an `if()` with `any()` to print "yes" if there are `any()` values greater than 4 in the vector x below.
```{r}
x <- c(3, 6, 7, 8, NA)

if(any(x > 4)){
    "yes"
}
```
Let's break this down.
```{r}
x > 4
```

```{r}
any(x > 4)
```

4. Modify the code above to check if there any values that are missing in x. You can tell if an element in a vector is missing using the function `is.na()`.

```{r}
if(any(is.na(x))){
    "yes there are missing values"
}
```
```{r}
x
```

Let's break that down.
```{r}
is.na(x)
```

```{r}
any(is.na(x))
```

5. Modify the code you wrote for task 3 to check if there are any values greater than 8. This will likely throw an error. Can you reason why this might be giving you an error? See the documentation for `any()` to see how to address this.

```{r}
if(any(x > 8)){
    "There are values greater than 8"
}
```

```{r}
x
```

```{r}
x > 8
```

```{r}
any(x > 8)
```

```{r}
if(NA){
    "There are values greater than 8"
}
```

How do we correct this? Using na.rm = T
```{r}
if(any(x > 8, na.rm = T)){
    "There are values greater than 8"
} else {
    "There are no values greater than 8"
}
```

6. Check if `all()` the values in vector x are not missing. If yes print "yes" else print "no".

```{r}
if(all(!is.na(x))) {
    "yes"
} else {
    "no"
}
```


```{r}
x
```

```{r}
!is.na(x)
```

```{r}
!F
```

```{r}
all(!is.na(x))
```

So the logical operators that we use commonly are

The not operator !
The AND operator &
The OR operator |

##Task Set 2: Vectorized Ifs
1. Use an `if_else()` statement to create a character vector that indicates whether a given value in vector x (from previous task set) is missing. It should be marked "missing" if a value is missing and "not missing" otherwise.
```{r}
x
```

```{r}
if_else(is.na(x), "missing", "not missing")
```

2. Load the gapminder and tidyverse packages
```{r}
library(gapminder); library(tidyverse)
```


3. Use the `if_else()` in a `mutate()` to add a new column to the gapminder data that indicates whether the year is greater than 2000.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    mutate(greater2000 = if_else(year > 2000, "greater", "lower"))
```

4. Make sure you have already loaded the tidyverse and gapminder before you start this. Complete the code below (the `group_by()` and `if_else()`). For every year I would like to mark the `incomeGroup` variable as "Higher" if it is above the median `gdpPercap` for that year (global median) and "Lower" otherwise. The subsequent plot explores the relationship between `incomeGroup` and the `lifeExp`. How would you interpret it?

```{r, fig.width = 9}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    mutate(incomeGroup = if_else(gdpPercap > median(gdpPercap, na.rm = T), "Higher", "Lower")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = lifeExp, colour = incomeGroup)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
    labs(title = str_wrap("Over time life expectancy in high income countries have converged while those in low income countries have diverged", width = 70),
         y = "Life Expectancy",
         colour = "Income Group") +
    ggthemes::theme_tufte() +
    theme(
        legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.title.x = element_blank()
    )
    
    
```


Let's break that down a bit. Let's output the median after grouping.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    mutate(medianValue = median(gdpPercap, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    select(country, year, medianValue, gdpPercap) %>% 
    arrange(year, country)
```

Let's test this
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year == 1952) %>% 
    summarise(median(gdpPercap, na.rm = T))
```

The next step is to establish a condition within an if else statement
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    mutate(medianValue = median(gdpPercap, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    select(country, year, medianValue, gdpPercap) %>% 
    mutate(incomeGroup = if_else(gdpPercap > medianValue, "Greater", "Lower")) %>% 
    arrange(year, country)
```

```{r, fig.width = 9}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    mutate(medianValue = median(gdpPercap, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    select(country, year, medianValue, gdpPercap, lifeExp) %>% 
    mutate(incomeGroup = if_else(gdpPercap > medianValue, "Greater", "Lower")) %>% 
    arrange(year, country) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = lifeExp, colour = incomeGroup)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
    labs(title = str_wrap("Over time life expectancy in high income countries have converged while those in low income countries have diverged", width = 70),
         y = "Life Expectancy",
         colour = "Income Group") +
    ggthemes::theme_tufte() +
    theme(
        legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.title.x = element_blank()
    )
```

4. Complete the following code to create a new variable called incomeGroup that cuts the `gdpPercap` variable based on the median value of the `gdpPercap` every year. The final variable should have 4 levels - Low income, low middle income, middle income, high middle income and high income. I have complete one of the levels for you in the code. Complete the rest - gdpPercap < 0.75 x median(gdpPercap) is "Low middle income", gdpPercap < 2 x median(gdpPercap) is "Middle income", gdpPercap < 4 x median(gdpPercap) is "High middle income" and everything else is high income.
```{r, fig.width = 12}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    mutate(incomeGroups = case_when(
        gdpPercap < 0.25 * median(gdpPercap) ~ "Low income",
        gdpPercap < 0.75 * median(gdpPercap) ~ "Low middle income",
        gdpPercap < 2 * median(gdpPercap) ~ "Middle income",
        gdpPercap < 4 * median(gdpPercap) ~ "High middle income",
        TRUE ~ "High Income"
    )) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_wrap(~incomeGroups, nrow = 1) +
    labs(title = str_wrap("Over time life expectancy in high income countries have converged while those in low income countries have diverged", width = 90),
         y = "Life Expectancy",
         colour = "Income Group") +
    theme_tufte() +
    theme(
        legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)
    )
```


##Task Set 3: Write a for loop
1. Create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 50 store it in a variable

2. Write a for loop that returns "even" if a number in the vector you created above is even and "odd" otherwise. Store the results from this in a variable called odds_evens. You can initiate the `odds_evens` vector like this - `odds_evens <- vector("character", length = length(x))`. You can establish if a value is even by checking if the remainder when you divide it by 2 is zero. The syntax for this is `value %% 2 == 0`, where value is the number you are comparing.

3. Now do the same thing with an `if_else()` statement and store the results in a
