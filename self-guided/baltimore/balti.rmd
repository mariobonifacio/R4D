This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse); library(lubridate); library(scales); library(ggthemes)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

```{r}
balti_2010 <- read_csv('DEC_10_SF1.csv')
balti_2017 <- read_csv('ACS_17_5YR.csv')

raw_2010 <- vector(mode = 'integer')
raw_2017 <- vector(mode = 'integer')

for(i in 1:nrow(balti_2010)) {
  raw_2010 <- append(raw_2010, sample(x = balti_2010[[i, "min"]]:balti_2010[[i, "max"]], size = round(balti_2010[[i, "count_2010"]]), replace = T))
}

raw_2017 <- append(raw_2017, abs(round(rnorm(4000, 46, 5))))

for(i in 1:nrow(balti_2017)) {
  raw_2017 <- append(raw_2017, sample(x = balti_2017[[i, "min"]]:balti_2017[[i, "max"]], size = round(balti_2017[[i, "count_2017"]]), replace = T))
}

raw_2010 <- append(raw_2010, abs(round(rnorm(10000, 75, 10))))

raw_2017 <- append(raw_2017, abs(round(rnorm(10000, 20, 6))))
raw_2017 <- append(raw_2017, abs(round(rnorm(2000, 20, 1))))

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
