"s   The 2014 CPS ASEC included redesigned questions for income and health insurance coverage. All of the approximately 98,000 addresses were selected to receive the improved set of health insurance coverage items. The improved income questions were implemented using a split panel design.  Approximately 68,000 addresses were selected to receive a set of income questions similar to those used in the 2013 CPS ASEC. The remaining 30,000 addresses were selected to receive the redesigned income questions. The source of data for this table is the CPS ASEC sample of 98,000 addresses. ",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Note: This table uses the householder's person weight to describe characteristics of people living in households. As a result, estimates of the number of households do not match estimates of housing units from the Housing Vacancy Survey (HVS). The HVS is weighted to housing units, rather than the population, in order to more accurately estimate the number of occupied and vacant housing units. If you are primarily interested in housing inventory estimates, then see the published tables and reports here: http://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/. If you are primarily interested in characteristics about the population and people who live in households, then see the H table series and reports here: http://www.census.gov/hhes/families/data/cps.html.",,,,,,,,,,,,
