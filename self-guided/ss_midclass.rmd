This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse); library(nycflights13)

col_names <- names(flights)

output <- vector(mode = 'numeric', length = length(col_names))

for(i in seq_along(col_names)) {
  col_data <- flights[col_names[i]]
  if(is.numeric(col_data)) {
    output[i] <-mean(col_data, na.rm = T) %>%
      round(2)
  } else {output[i] <- 1}
}

for(i in seq_along(col_names)) {
  col_data <- flights[col_names[1]]
  if(is.numeric(unlist(col_data))) {
    output[i] <-mean(col_data, na.rm = T) %>%
      round(2)
  } else {output[i] <- 1}
}
?unlist
output



?is.numeric

str(col_data)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
