## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
tot_tests <- read_csv("full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand.csv")
tot_cases <- read_csv("total-cases-covid-19.csv")
tot_deaths <- read_csv("total-deaths-covid-19.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
BL <- (141:199) / 200
f1 <- 

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
