## Comments
1. Excellent job with the addition of pictures.
2. Great use of the lead up text to set the stage
3. Remove elements that you don't need to make your case
4. Explain charts. What is happing in the boxplot?
5. Apply a [theme](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#appearance-and-style)
6. Elaborate more on your answers, bring more complexity to your analysis i.e. what are some of the follow up questions you might have from these two charts?

## Introduction

![Delayed flights are a pain](Flight Delays.jpg)

**Impact of flight delays**
In a study commissioned by FAA - flight delays have a major impact on the airline business and passenger time loss

"Flight delay is a serious and widespread problem in the United States. Increasing flight delays place a significant strain on the U.S. air travel system and cost airlines,    passengers and society many billions of dollars each year. The $8.3 billion airline component consists of increased expenses for crew, fuel and maintenance, among others. The $16.7 billion passenger component is based on the passenger time lost due to schedule buffer, delayed flights, flight cancellations and missed connections. The $2.2 billion cost from lost demand is an estimate of the welfare loss incurred by passengers who avoid air travel as the result of delays."

**To know more**.
I am studying the flights data from NYC during 2013 to learn what are the reasons for flight delays. 

**My initial hypothesis deals with 3 elements:**

1. Airport Congestion 

2. Weather elements 

3. Airline challenges 

With These 3 elements I want to see if I can develop a Regression model that brings in these factor to say what is my average deal given the variables at the time of the departure. 

## Airport Congestion
![Flights are back to back](Airport Congestion.jpg)
Airport congestion is one theme I have been looking into.

The best way to analyse congestion is 

1. The number of flights in a given airport or 

2. The number of flights leaving from an airport at any given time

I want to focus more on the number of flights leaving from an airport at any given time.


**My null hypothesis**:  the number of flights leaving from an airport at any given time is not having an impact on flight delays
I am looking to disprove this null hypothesis
```{r}
flights
```


```{r,fig.width=9}
## Does the number of flights leaving from an airport affect mean departure delay
library(tidyverse); library(nycflights13)
flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 30) %>%
  group_by(origin,time_hour) %>% 
  summarise(meanDelay = mean((dep_delay), na.rm = T),
              nFlights = n())%>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(nFlights<20)%>%
   ggplot(aes(x = factor(nFlights), y = meanDelay)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA)+
  facet_wrap(~origin)+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(25,200))
    # geom_point(aes(colour = origin)) +
    # geom_smooth(method = "lm")


```

## Airline challenges
Airline challenges is the second theme I have been looking into. This theme can influence both arrival and departure delayes

There can be a number of airline issues sucj

1. The plane used by the airline is old / the engine type which could delay arrival times

2. A given plane / airline doing mutliple trips in a given days that could lead to departure delays


I want to focus more on the number of flights for a given plane if a flight has done 2 or more trips in a given day out of an airport .


**My null hypothesis**:  departure delay is not influenced if a flight has done 2 or more trip in a given day out of an airport
I am looking to disprove this null hypothesis

```{r}

```


```{r}
#Does the departure delay increases if a flight has done 2 or more trip in a given day out of an airport
library(tidyverse); library(nycflights13)
left_join(flights %>% 
              select(1:3, tailnum,origin,time_hour,dep_delay), 
          planes %>%
              select(tailnum, manufacturer), 
          by = "tailnum") %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 30) %>% 
  group_by(origin, month, day, tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(meanDelay = mean((dep_delay), na.rm = T),
              nObs = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(nObs > 0)%>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = nObs, y = meanDelay)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = origin)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")

 
```
