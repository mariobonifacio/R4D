**Due Date**: Sunday, April 28th

## Background

**PROBLEM:** Here, the problem is that flight delays are unpredictable. Not only that, mis-timing your ride to the airport could be costly; Arrive late and you may miss your flight altogether, but arrive early and you'll spend even more uncomportable, unproductive time at the gate

**GOAL:** My ultimate goal is to be able to best predict a flight's departure delay. In an ideal world, all flights would simply leave on time. In a second-best world, each airline would contact travelers directly with flight delay information that was accurate and timely enough to be actionable. Alas, neither of those are the case and so in the world we live in, my goal is to better predict delay using weather and flight data.

**HYPOTHESIS:** 


## Setting up

```{r}
### Install packages, as needed 
# install.packages('tidyverse') 
# install.packages('skimr') 
# install.package('lubridate')

library(tidyverse); library(skimr); library(nycflights13); library(lubridate)

flt_wx <- flights %>%
  left_join(weather,by = c('origin','time_hour')) %>%
  mutate(wkday = wday(as.Date(time_hour)) 
        ,midness = abs(sched_dep_time-11.99)
		    ,decness = abs(month.x-5.99)
		    ,mo_day = mdy(paste(month.x,day.x,2013))) %>%
  group_by(mo_day) %>%
  mutate(day_flt = length(mo_day)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(dep_delay,temp:visib,wkday,decness,midness,day_flt)
  
```
