**General Instructions**

1. Use the cheatsheets and the keyboard shortcuts as you work through the assignment.
2. Each task should be answered right below the question.
3. The assignment should be submitted via a shareable github link on the assignments channel in Slack.
4. Make sure the notebook is neatly formatted and looks good when you preview it.

##Task set 1: Data types and structures
1. List the 4 most common (data) types of atomic vectors.
    + Answer: Logical, integer, numeric or double, and character

2. Create atomic vectors of the 4 common types covered in class. Print their length and type.

```{r}
log_vec <- c(T)
int_vec <- c(1L)
dbl_vec <- c(1.0)
chr_vec <- c('One')

length(log_vec); typeof(log_vec)
length(int_vec); typeof(int_vec)
length(dbl_vec); typeof(dbl_vec)
length(chr_vec); typeof(chr_vec)
```

3. List the heirarchy of data types for coercion
    + Answer: logical > integer > numeric or double > character

4. Explain why the output of following bits of code is TRUE (explain what is happening in terms of coercion): 

```{r}
"1" == 1
```
Answer: 1 is coerced into a character vector

```{r}
FALSE == 0
```
Answer: FALSE is coerced into a numeric vector

3. Create a list that holds the 4 common types of atomic vectors you created in task 2.
vct_list list()
```{r}
vec_list <- list(log_vec,int_vec,dbl_vec,chr_vec)
vec_list
```
4. Create a data frame with 3 columns and 5 rows using the `data.frame()` function

```{r}
df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b=2, c=3)
df
```
5. Create the same data frame as above using `tibble()` function

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df_tibble <- tibble(a = 1:5, b=2, c=3)
df_tibble
```

6. Use the `str()`, `class()` and or `glimpse()` command to see the difference between the dataframe and tibble create in 4 and 5.

```{r}
str(df);str(df_tibble)
class(df);class(df_tibble)
glimpse(df);glimpse(df_tibble)
```
data.frame creates a data.frame whereas tibble creates a tbl_df

7. Fill in the blanks. 

    + A data frame is a _TWO-_ dimensionsional data structure in R that consists of __VECTORS__ of __EQUAL__ length

8. What is the difference between an atomic vector and a list?
    + Answer: An atomic vector contains only one data type, but a list can contain multiple types

##Task set 2: Data manipulation using dplyr

**INSTRUCTIONS**: You will be using the tidyverse and nycflights13 packages for the next set of tasks. Refer to the documentation on http://tidyverse.org or use the help pages if you do not understand a function fully.

1. Load the tidyverse and nycflights13 packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse); library(nycflights13)
```

2. Describe two ways in which you can use RStudio confirm that a package has been loaded into your current R session? (Hint: One of them is a dropdown menu and the other a list of checkboxes)

    + Answer: In the Environment tab, click the 'Global environment' dropdown and ensure the package is listed or click the Packages and look to ensure the package's box is checked

3. Use the `distinct()` command to identify the unique combinations of airline carriers and origin airports in the flights data.

```{r}
flights %>%
  distinct(carrier,origin)

```

4. Use the `one_of()` helper function to select the following columns -  year, month, day, dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, from the flights data.

```{r}
flights %>%
  select(one_of('year', 'month', 'day', 'dep_time', 'sched_dep_time', 'dep_delay','arr_time'))
```

5. Use the `slice()` function to slice the first 10 rows in the flights data.

```{r}
flights %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

6. Perform the same operation as the previous task but this time use `filter()`. (Hint: Search for how to get the row numbers of a tibble)

```{r}
filter(flights,row_number() <= 10)
```

7. Use the `top_n()` command to identify the top 5 flights out of NYC that experienced the greatest arrival delays in 2013.

```{r}
flights %>%
  top_n(5,arr_delay) %>%
  select(1:3,carrier,flight,arr_delay) %>%
  arrange(desc(arr_delay))
```

8. Use `top_n()` along with `arrange()` and `slice()` to pull out the 50th most delayed departure from NYC in 2013 (Not all 50, just the 50th). 
```{r}
flights %>%
  top_n(50,dep_delay) %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay)) %>%
  slice(50) %>%
  select(1:3,carrier,flight,dep_delay)
  
```

9. Do the same thing as the previous task using 
    + `row_number()`
    + and `dense_rank()`
```{r}
flights %>%
  filter(dense_rank(flights$dep_delay) == 50) %>%
  select(1:3,carrier,flight,dep_delay)
```

10. The result from `row_number()` and `top_n()` are the same, while that from `dense_rank()` is different. Why?

    + Answer: The dep_delay that falls in the 50th position is tied with several others. In dense_rank, 1749 flights are tied for 50th so it returns all of these. row_number() and top_n() take whatever's 50th

11. Find the top 10 airline carrier that had the highest average departure delays in 2013 using `group_by()`, `summarise()` and other functions you have learnt previously.
```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  mutate(carr_avg = mean(dep_delay,na.rm = T)) %>%
  select(carrier,carr_avg) %>%
  unique() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  top_n(10,desc(carr_avg)) %>%
  arrange(desc(carr_avg))
```

12. Use `group_by()` with `mutate()` to create a new variable called `comparativeDelay` which is the difference between departure delay and the average delay in each origin airport for every hour in 2013 (checkout the `time_hour` variable in the flights data). Store the result in a variable called `comparativeDelays`.
```{r}
comparativeDelays <- flights %>%
  group_by(origin,time_hour) %>%
  mutate(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm = T)) %>%
  mutate(comparativeDelay = dep_delay - avg_delay) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(origin,carrier,hour,avg_delay,comparativeDelay)

comparativeDelays

```

13. Now group the `comparativeDelays` tibble by carriers to print the top 10 airlines with the greatest average comparative delays.
```{r}
comparativeDelays %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  mutate(avg_comp_delay = mean(comparativeDelay,na.rm = T)) %>%
  select(-origin,-hour,-avg_delay,-comparativeDelay) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  unique() %>%
  top_n(10,avg_comp_delay) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_comp_delay))

```

14. Use `group_by()` with filter to print the 5 most delayed flights from each origin. Your printed tibble should have 15 rows.
```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  top_n(5,dep_delay) %>%
  select(origin,month,day,carrier,flight,dep_delay) %>%
  arrange(origin,desc(dep_delay))
```

15. The air authority in NY wants to penalize carriers for departure delays. Which of the three metrics (task 1, 3 or 4) would you recommend they use to identify the airlines to penalize. Why?

    + Answer: Average comparative delay is best because it's the only one that tries to correct for origin and time-of-day effects
    
##Task set 3: R markdown

    + **Make me bold**

> Make me a block quote

2. Create a level three header called "My level 3 header" under this line 

### My level 3 header

* three

4. Use chunk options to hide the output and the code from the chunk below in the previewed notebook.

print("Hide me and the code that created me")
```
